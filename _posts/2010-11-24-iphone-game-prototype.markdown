In February 2009, I made the smart decision of buying my first Apple computer (a Mac Mini). At first I wouldn't believe it will replace my desktop PC, but now it became my primary workstation.

As soon as I bought it, I began learning Objective C and Cocoa Touch in order to get a glimpse of what the iPhone SDK has to offer. The results were amazing. Though I did not have enough time to develop a full functional application, I managed to create this prototype which is using Box2D for the physics and Cocos 2D for the graphics.

The idea is to reduce the area in which the balls move by touching the screen exactly where you would like to sever. If during this process you touch a ball by mistake, the number of lives will decrease.

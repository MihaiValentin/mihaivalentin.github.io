I've created Lunr-languages, that features a collection of languages stemmers and stopwords for <a style="color: #4183c4;" href="http://lunrjs.com/">Lunr</a> Javascript library (which currently only supports English).

The following languages are available:

* German
* French
* Spanish
* Italian
* Dutch
* Danish
* Portuguese
* Finnish
* Romanian
* Hungarian
* Russian
* Norwegian

Hippotomate is an app that helps QA automation engineers develop and debug their tests.

Hippotomate will help you analyze errors, view screenshots, run tests step by step and see what's going on.

I started Hippotomate as a side project, and went from idea, concept, design, architecture, coding to preparing an MVP and promoting it to get early user feedback.

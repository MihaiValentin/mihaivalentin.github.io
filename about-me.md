## My skills and expertise

As a Web Software Architect, I help stakeholders transform the product vision into reality.

In order to achieve this, I use knowledge & experience from two dimensions: <strong>depth</strong> and <strong>broadness</strong>.

* <strong>Depth</strong> represents my core specialization: software architecture, programming, algorithms, debugging, optimizing, large scale web front-end/back-end systems, databases, scalability, infrastructure (&AWS), continuous integration/delivery, test automation, Linux and many others.
* <strong>Broadness</strong> represents topics I'm deeply passionate about, such as: product management, user experience, analytics, machine learning & deep learning, audio programming and many others.

Below you'll find the tools, languages and frameworks I use:
